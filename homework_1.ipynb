The review score of a listing shows a positive correlation with its location score. This again is not too surprising since the location score is a major factor of the overall listing score. However, there seems to be no clear correlation between location and overall review score and any other of the values, in particular not the price of the listing.

        "In the top ten variables correlating with price we again see similarties with any room type other than whole house/apt showing the strongest negative correlation with price in both cities. Somewhat surprisingly, a super strict cancellation policy in in Boston is the first non room type related variable on the list while it does not show up in Seattle at all. Extremely high priced listings in Boston seem to be very strict with their cancellation policy, possibly to avoid hoax bookings or an unreasonably high cancerllation rate for these kind of rentals. However, why this is not the case in Seattle I am not 100% clear. Further findings in this list support the earlier findings of the heatmaps that number of accomodated people as well as number of beds, bedrooms and bathrooms all correlate positively with price and are among the top ten in both cities."
